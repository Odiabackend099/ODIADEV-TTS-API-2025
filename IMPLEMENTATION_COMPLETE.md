## 🔧 Infrastructure Prerequisites

### Manual Setup Required
These tasks require administrator privileges and cannot be automated:

1. **Docker Desktop Installation**
   - Download from: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
   - Requires Windows admin privileges
   - After installation, run `scripts/build-and-run.ps1`

2. **AWS CLI Installation**  
   - Download from: https://aws.amazon.com/cli/
   - Requires Windows admin privileges
   - After installation, run `aws configure` and `scripts/deploy-ecr.ps1`

### Ready-to-Execute Scripts
Once infrastructure is installed, these scripts are ready for immediate execution:

```powershell
# Local Development
./scripts/build-and-run.ps1
./scripts/health-check.ps1 -Local
./scripts/issue-api-key.ps1
./scripts/test-tts.ps1

# Cloud Deployment  
./scripts/deploy-ecr.ps1
./scripts/deploy-ec2.ps1
./scripts/health-check.ps1 -Remote -Url "https://yourdomain.com"
```

## 🎯 Current Status

### What Works Right Now
- ✅ All automation scripts created and syntax-validated
- ✅ Environment configuration system
- ✅ API key management simulation
- ✅ TTS testing framework with mock output
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation and guides
- ✅ Cloud deployment automation scripts
- ✅ Health monitoring and validation scripts

### What Needs Manual Action
- 🔧 Install Docker Desktop (requires admin privileges)
